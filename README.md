# Simplex-Method
This repository contains a C++ and Python  implementation of a Linear Programming Solver using the Simplex Method. Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.
Features:
Simplex Method Implementation: The code utilizes the Simplex Method, a popular optimization algorithm for linear programming problems.

User Input: Takes user input for the number of variables, constraints, coefficients, and constraints' right-hand side values.

Optimization: Finds the optimal solution for the linear programming problem and displays the results.
